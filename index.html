                <blockquote><p><strong>My First Experience With Walmart Grocery’s Free Pickup Service
</strong></p><p><strong>Whether you’re a parent trying to avoid the “Can I get a toy?” conversation or a single person who would rather not leave the car during a storm, you can see how this service can be a huge convenience.

I gave Walmart Grocery a try to find out if it’s as good as it sounds. Let me walk you through how it went…
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>With an increasing percentage of the population preferring on-demand TV, there is no reason to restrict oneself to what the mainstream channels air.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Netflix is an excellent online streaming service that lets you enjoy on-demand content from its humungous library.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Reserve a Time and Start Shopping
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>To get started with Walmart Grocery, I signed in to my account . You can also access online grocery directly from the Walmart app.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>You might expect that Walmart would increase the prices for customers who use the free pickup service, but that’s not the case! The retailer guarantees that you pay the same low prices as folks who shop in the store.
</strong></p><p><strong>Walmart’s substitution policy can also work in your favor. If you choose to allow substitutions and one is made, you’ll always be charged for the lower priced item.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>After I placed my first Walmart Grocery order, I received an email with information on when it would be ready and where exactly I would pick it up at my local store.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>When my order was ready the next morning, I got an email and a text to let me know. To save time, the text suggested that I check in using the Walmart Grocery app when I was on my way
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>My biggest worry was getting lost while searching for the pickup area. Although I’ve been to my local Walmart dozens of times, I never paid attention to the orange signs until I placed this order.</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>I showed up during the middle of my time slot because that’s how Kroger suggests customers of its own grocery pickup service can beat the rush. I was the only grocery pickup customer there!
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong> Walmart associate brought my groceries to my car two minutes later. He told me about a substitution that had to be made and I signed for my order. He then loaded the groceries into my trunk in less than three minutes.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>In addition to saving time, Walmart Grocery can save you money! There are often coupon codes for the service, including $10 off your first order of $50 or more
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>It would only affect the websites from which you would be performing TV shows and movie streaming.</strong></p><p><strong>
